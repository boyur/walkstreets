# Walking Streets project

###About

The first step to start improving the city pedestrian experience is awareness about current conditions of the pedestrian environment.  “[Walking Streets](http://walkstreets.org)” is an independent study of pedestrian conditions research in the center of Moscow. The width of sidewalks, accessibility to venues, underpasses, street noise pollution and interesting places have been investigated during research.  
  
There four stories about the city:  
* [Sidewalks map](http://walkstreets.org/#mode=sidewalks) — sidewalk witdth research report
* [Accessibility map](http://walkstreets.org/#mode=accessibility) — how accessible places are, there are mapped venues in term of accessibility for wheelchairs and trollers, steps and underpasses
* [Noise pollution map](http://walkstreets.org/#mode=noise) — a dataset of noise polution readings have been analyzed and mapped
* [Interesting places](http://walkstreets.org/#mode=places) – matched available wikipedia-articles popularity statistics in the research area, see more — [Wikipedia Dump Geoparser](https://github.com/Casyfill/WikiGeoParser)
